```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(asif)
```

## Usage

The `asif` package provides a set of novelty functions aimed at making nested
logic a little more readable than abusing `ifelse`.  Note that the parentheses
around the logical tests are required.


```{r, usage}
result_new <- mtcars %if%
    (mpg > 30) %then% 30 %elif%
    (mpg > 25) %then% 25 %elif%
    (mpg > 20) %then% 20 %elif%
    (mpg > 15) %then% 15 %else% 0
```

## Base R

Compare this to base R where the nested parentheses can get out of hand pretty
quickly.

```{r, base-r}

result_old <- with(mtcars,
  ifelse(mpg > 30, 30,
    ifelse(mpg > 25, 25,
      ifelse(mpg > 20, 20,
        ifelse(mpg > 15, 15, 0)))))


## results are the same
table(result_old, result_new)
all.equal(result_old, result_new)
```
